____  

**Installing ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery**  

The following scripts will download the selected **ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery** image, create a container, setup and populate the directory structures, create the run-time scripts, and install the application's desktop file(s).  

The _default_ values will install all directories and contents in the **docker host** user's home directory (refer to [Mapping docker host resources to the docker container](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery/wiki/QuickStart#mapping)),  

____  
**ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:latest**  
  
    docker run --rm \
               -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \
               -e LMS_BASE="${HOME}/.local" \

               --name=debian-pull-gallery-9.5.0 \
           ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.0 lms-setup  

____  
  
Refer to [Mapping docker host resources to the docker container](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery/wiki/QuickStart#mapping) for a discussion of **lms-setup** and what it does.  

____  

**Running the installed scripts**

After running the above command script, and using the settings indicated, the docker host directories, mapped as shown in the above tables, will be configured as follows:

+ the executable scripts have been copied to **~/bin**;  
+ the application desktop file(s) have been copied to **~/.local/share/applications**, and are availablie in any _task bar_ menu;  
+ the associated **debian-pull-gallery-"version"** execution script(s) (shown below) will be found in **~/.local/bin**, and _should_ be customized with proper local volume names.  

____  

**Execution scripts**  

**ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:latest**
  
    docker run -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} \
               -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
               -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:${HOME}/.Xauthority \
               -v /media/sf_ImageDownloads:/data \
               -v /media/sf_ImageDownloads/url-lists:/batch \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-latest:/root \
               --name=debian-pull-gallery-latest \
           ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:latest  

____  
**ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.0**
  
    docker run -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} \
               -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
               -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:${HOME}/.Xauthority \
               -v ${HOME}/Pictures:/data \
               -v ${HOME}/Pictures/url-lists:/batch \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-9.5.0:/root \
               --name=debian-pull-gallery-9.5.0 \
           ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.0  

____  
Refer to [Mapping docker host resources to the docker container](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery/wiki/QuickStart#mapping) for a discussion of customizing the executable scripts..  

____  

**Regarding edge**  

For the very brave, if an _edge_ tag is available, these instructions will download, rename and install the _edge_ version.  Good luck.  

____  

**ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:edge**  

**edge** is the development tag for the **9.5.1** release tag.

    docker pull ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:edge
    docker tag ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:edge ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.1
    docker run -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \
               -e LMS_BASE="${HOME}/.local" \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker:/conf \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-9.5.1:/root \
               --name=debian-pull-gallery-9.5.1 \
           ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.1 lms-setup  

optional step:

    docker rmi ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:edge  

To create and run the container, run **Pull Gallery** from the _Graphics_ category of any desktop menu, or from the command-line, the following should work:

    ~/.local/bin/debian-pull-gallery-9.5.1  

or,

    docker run -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} \
               -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
               -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:${HOME}/.Xauthority \
               -v ${HOME}/Pictures/test:/data \
               -v ${HOME}/Pictures/url-lists:/batch \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-9.5.1:/root \
               --name=debian-pull-gallery-9.5.1 \
           ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery:9.5.1    

____  

**Persistence**  
In order to persist the Eclipse application state, a location on the docker _host_ must be provided to store the necessary information.  This can be accomplished with the following volume option in the run command:

    -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-"version":/root  

Since the information is stored in the docker _container_ **/root** directory, this statement maps the user's **~/.config/docker/debian-pull-gallery-"version"** docker _host_ directory to the **/root** directory in the docker _container_.  

____  
**Timestamps**  
It is important to keep the time and date on docker _host_ files that have been created and/or modified by the docker _containter_ synchronized with the docker _host_'s settings. This can be accomplished as follows:

    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro  

____  
**About the X11 Server / GUI Stack**  
The **ewsdocker/debian-pull-gallery** image is built on the [ewsdocker/debian-openjre](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-openjre/wiki) docker image, which is built on the [ewsdocker/debian-base-gui](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-base-gui/wiki) docker image. These two docker images provide the **X11-Server** stack and several **GUI** system elements.  The **X11-Server** stack is configured in the _docker run_ command as follows:

    docker run -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} \
               -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
               -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:${HOME}/.Xauthority \

Since these options are _the same for all gui containers_, they should probably be the first options in the docker run command.
